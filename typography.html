  <h2>
    Problem

  <h3>
    Getting things started
  </h3>
  <p>
    I got feedback from a few people who used FindBot frequently that typing the word "find" before every query wasn't inline with how they expected to use it. I also <a href="#">saw</a> from looking at the analytics a few individuals not returning to FindBot again once they received the "don't understand response". This small design decision was chosen originally because I had the grand <strong>plan</strong> of adding a whole array of functionality that wasn't to do with search. However, this greatly affected the user experience and <em>taught me</em> to really focus on doing one thing and doing it well. FindBot's new features are now completely driven by seeing how people interact with it and talking about how they use it.
  </p>
  <p>
    What's next for FindBot? Well, JIRA and BitBucket are still a hassle to search. And it's a requested feature among project managers. With Elasticsearch we can even do more relational searches. The plan for FindBot is to become a universal search for all things project related.
