## Personal Projects
### [FindBot](/work/findbot)
Finding specific project folders on my company server was really hard. So I created a Slack bot for my colleagues to locate and open project folders quickly. They use it all the time.

It's made up of micro-service-esque Python and Node.js apps. These handle indexing all the project folders with ElasticSearch and providing a conversational chat interface with Botkit.
