        <h1>My Plans for Kinopio</h1>

        <p>Over the last couple months, itâ€™s been super encouraging to hear from teachers, programmers, designers, and students about how they use Kinopio to map out and make sense of their ideas, feelings, and plans.</p>

        <p>Right now Iâ€™m working on features to make it easier to share and collaborate with other people on those spaces. But Iâ€™m taking a little break to answer some  questions that really deserve public answers.</p>

        <h2 id="how-will-kinopio-make-money">How Will Kinopio Make Money?</h2>

        <p>My plan is to eventually require people to pay $4/month to create more than 100 or so cards. I want the pricing to feel simple, straightforward, and obvious.</p>

        <h2 id="what-about-user-data-and-privacy">What About User Data and Privacy?</h2>

        <p>I havenâ€™t written a legalese privacy policy yet. But either way, hereâ€™s the common sense human version.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Kinopio wonâ€™t show you ads of any kind.</li>
          <li>No cookies are used for anything. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LocalStorage</code> is used to save your info. Unlike cookies, other websites cannot access <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localStorage</code>.</li>
          <li>To share spaces and collaborate, your user data and spaces will be hosted on AWS (via Heroku). Besides this necessity, your data will not be shared with any third party.</li>
          <li>The only analytics I use are from <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/">Netlify</a>. Which does not allow me to uniquely identify anyone.</li>
          <li>Children, and anyone else, will always be able to use Kinopio anonymously and collaborate with others on public spaces.</li>
          <li>You can permanently <a href="https://www.are.na/block/4788320">remove all</a> of your data anytime.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="what-happens-to-my-data-if-kinopio-dies">What Happens to My Data if Kinopio&nbsp;Dies?</h2>

        <p>We donâ€™t live in a deterministic world. I could do everything right and still run out of money without being able to turn Kinopio into a healthy, sustainable business. If that happens, you wonâ€™t lose any data and Kinopio will still be usable.</p>

        <p>Kinopio consists of two codebases, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">client</code> app that runs when you hit <a href="https://kinopio.club">kinopio.club</a> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">server</code> app which will enable sharing and collaboration. The client app is like a cockroach, itâ€™s tiny, free to host, and doesnâ€™t depend on a connection to the server app. So if I canâ€™t afford to run the kinopio server anymore, I can just switch it off and you can continue to use Kinopio as you do now â€“ with all your data intact.</p>

        <p>Besides all that, thereâ€™s already a bunch of ways to export your data. Either as entire spaces, or just the specific cards you care about.</p>
